# Rest Rest Convalesce

Rest Rest Convalesce is a game about the lengthy, boring road back from invasive surgery. Try to maintain your patience and manage your pain as you pass long hours in your living room waiting for your body to heal. But no matter how tedious your life becomes, make sure not to overextend yourself!
